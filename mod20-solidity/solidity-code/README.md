This repository contains Solidity code for three smart contracts that handle compensation distribution in one of three ways:
* Associate Profit Splitter - This will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.
* Tiered Profit Splitter - Will distribute different percentages of incoming Ether to employees at different tiers/levels. For example, the CEO gets paid 60%, CTO 25%, and Bob gets 15%.
* Deferred Equity Plan - This models traditional company stock plans. This contract will automatically manage 1000 shares with an annual distribution of 250 over 4 years for a single employee.

This should be run over the Kovan Ethereum testnet.
